Here, as there are 20 rows and each row has a size of 
3 blocks, the total Space required is 20x3 = 60.
Thus, one table has 60 blocks. Therefore, considering
the normal Cuckoo Hashing Strucuture of using two tables, 
the total number of elements in a dataset can be at most
120. There is, however, no guarantee that all 120 elements
can be hashed and thus keeping a load factor close to 
5/6, we can achieve cases where collisions are minimum.
A dataset of 100 elements can be skewed and can result
in multiple cycles and therefore, it is recommended that
the number of elements that need to entered in the
database should not exceed 60 (as load factor is 1/2).
